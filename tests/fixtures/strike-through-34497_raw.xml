<p>Subsection “<bold>Grooming duration is controlled by <italic>cycle</italic> and <italic>clock”</italic></bold>: “The apparent absence of per from the second regulatory mechanism is consistent with the possibility that the two control mechanisms <strike>are</strike> operate independently.”</p>
<p>Discussion section: “…implying that the changes in grooming level <strike>are</strike> <strike>not</strike> may not be due to circadian defects.
