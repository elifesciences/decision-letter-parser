<p><bold>Decision letter</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ligand-dependent electrostatic control of anion access to the pore of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Criss Hartzell (Reviewer#1) and Alessio Accardi (Reviewer #2). <break /><break />The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. <break /><break />Summary:</p><p> <break />Lam and Dutzler discover that the negatively charged residues that form the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites act as an electrostatic barrier for the flow of anions once the pore has adopted the open conformation, thus acting as an additional activation gate in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. By introducing mutations in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sites in constitutively active mutants of TMEM16A and measuring their I-V relations at various Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations, the authors show that the binding of calcium reduces the two innermost energy barriers of an open channel through an electrostatic mechanism, allowing ions to flow. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the constitutively active mutants display pronounced outward rectification due to this electrostatic effect. Overall, these studies highlight a novel mechanism of regulation of ion permeation by a ligand. Nevertheless, the reviewers raise several concerns that should be addressed in the revised version. <break /><break />Essential revisions:</p><p> <break />1) I am not sure that I understand the permeation model. Why do the electrostatics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> affect only inward and not outward current? The energy profile in Figure 1D could not lead to rectification, because the height of each energy barrier is the same whether the ion is coming from the inside or the outside. Outward rectification requires an energy well between the barriers <italic>h</italic> and <italic>β</italic> so that the height of <italic>β</italic> is greater from the out&gt;in than the in&gt;out direction. It would seem that the depth of this well would be significant considering the degree of rectification observed. <break /><break />2) Furthermore, the second paragraph of the subsection “Data analysis” states that <italic>σ<sub>h</sub></italic> and <italic>σ<sub>β</sub></italic> are voltage-independent, but Figure 1G seems to show that <italic>σ<sub>β</sub></italic> is voltage-dependent. The statement in the next paragraph is rather inscrutable, as is the subsequent explanation about why the &quot;decay&quot; was omitted from the fits. What does &quot;inaccurate estimation of <italic>σ<sub>β</sub></italic>&quot; mean? It would be useful to know how the conclusions are affected by changing <italic>n</italic> in Equation 2. And why is <italic>σ<sub>h</sub></italic> not shown beyond Figure 1? <break /><break />3) Even though the G644P and Q649A mutations increase the baseline open probability of the channel, it is unclear whether the protein with any of these mutations still undergoes some gating-associated conformational changes. If this were the case, some of the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding on the rectification of the mutant channels could arise from these conformational changes rather than the simple electrostatic influence of the site and the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. To test for this possibility, the authors could use Mg<sup>2+</sup> instead of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as it is reported to compete with Ca<sup>2+</sup> without activating the channel. The authors should test whether the presence of internal magnesium in the context of either of the constitutively active mutants has the same effect as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as expected from their proposed mechanism. Although it is not necessary, I think it would be also interesting to test whether a trivalent cation could also bind and have a larger effect than Ca<sup>2+</sup>. <break /><break />4) Large portions of the data shown depend on the use of a permeation model for analysis, together with the use of several equations for permeation and electrostatics. I think these play such a central role in the manuscript that it would make the reading easier if some of these models and equations were described with more detail in the main text, rather than the Materials and methods section. </p>
