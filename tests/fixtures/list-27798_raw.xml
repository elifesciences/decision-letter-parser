<p>Cell line contamination is a long-standing and persistent problem in
academic, clinical and commercial research. The available solutions for
cell line authentication are clearly not sufficient, since contamination
is still a major economic burden on society despite having been
recognized nearly 50 years ago. Issues with cell line contamination and
authentication are very well described by Almeida et al 2016 PLOS
Biology. We would like to explain a couple of points raised:</p>

      <p>Contamination and rapid identification: cell line
      authentication benefits from being able to identify sample
      contamination in the earliest stage possible. The current US
      national guidelines by the ASN0002 state that a cell line is pure
      if the STRs have a match of 80% to one of the entries in the
      database. Only when the STR match &lt; 56% the cell line is
      considered contaminated. Our method is better and more applicable
      than existing methods in two crucial aspects:</p>

          <p>Cell line authentication is not a static one-off test:
          Transfer of a couple of cells from one culture to the other by
          human error happens. Only the cells that rapidly proliferate
          compared to the original cell line will jeopardize the
          research done over time. Therefore the <italic>periodic
          testing</italic> of all cell lines in the lab is crucial,
          since only periodic testing will reveal that a cell line is
          contaminated. The <italic>ATCC takes two weeks</italic> to
          return test results, which means that by the time a researcher
          gets his/her results back, the contaminant might have
          overgrown the culture. Our MinION sketching method provides a
          rapid, and local solution for periodic cell line testing to
          allow researchers to by fully aware of the state of their cell
          line(s) at the time of an experiment. Even with a
          contamination of 10% our method rarely provides a robust
          match, indicative of contaminants in the cell line. Plus, we
          can robustly pick up a contamination of 20%, which is an
          important two-fold improvement over the ASN0002 standard that
          only rejects a pure cell line when &lt; 56% matches.</p>

          <p>Sample mix-up: swapping cell lines does happen in
          laboratories from time to time and this would be a 100%
          contamination event. The MinION sketch would provide a
          perfect, instant sanity check prior to starting an experiment
          for any researcher.</p>

      <p>Contamination analysis using SNPs versus STRs: cancer cell
      lines are typically very unstable and proliferate rapidly. STRs
      are more likely to incur mutations than SNPs and therefore, even a
      pure cancer cell line typically will result in a non-homogenous
      mix of repeat lengths. Hence, the ASN0002 guidelines place a cut
      off at an 80% match for pure cancer cell lines. Our SNP-based
      MinION sketch therefore enables a higher accuracy for the
      detection of contaminations in cancer cell lines.</p>

      <p><bold>The reference database availability</bold>: the cancer
      cell line encyclopedia generated by the Broad Institute provides
      around a 1000 reference files for the general public to use. We
      have converted this database to the correct format for our
      pipeline and provide this with our manuscript, so that our method
      can easily be adopted by members of the research community. This
      is only the start, and the database will be updated as the number
      of cell lines available will increase. When our method is used for
      forensic purposes ethical issues need to be considered – however,
      the appropriate (government) bodies that regulate forensic
      research and investigations should be able to formulate
      regulations that allow for the use of our method alongside
      relevant reference databases (see below) in forensics.</p>

      <p>Cost: The costs of sequencing are continuing to plummet and
      this trend will most probably extend into the near future. When
      samples are multiplexed using 12 barcodes the costs of our MinION
      sketching method is currently already comparable to, and even
      lower than, the available cell line authentication method via the
      ATCC. The difference between our MinION sketching method versus
      the ATCC method is that researchers do not have to wait for two
      weeks to obtain the test results.</p>

      <p>DNA concentration: for cell line authentication we do not have
      to worry as much about the availability of the input DNA as the
      forensic field has to. Even without pushing the boundaries of the
      possible, we were able to identify an individual using 50ng DNA.
      Our method can be used in addition with a PCR amplification step
      of informative SNPs, which could be an expansion of the method in
      the situation of an extremely low input DNA sample. We do concede
      that this would add a time consuming step in the protocol,
      however.</p>

      <p><bold>Expansion to other fields</bold>: Our method might very
      well be suitable for other fields, such as mice cell line
      authentication, and for testing the purity of <italic>C.
      elegans</italic>, Drosophila, plant and even yeast stocks. This
      paper can be the first step to make purity testing more convenient
      for researchers from disciplines across the life sciences – this
      is the reason why we think this paper would be perfect for eLife
      with its broad readership.</p>

<p>Why is a PCR-free approach an advantage? Our reasoning is the
following:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>First, having to perform PCR adds yet another step in the
    protocol that takes time.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Second, the current protocols mostly use human-specific PCR
    primers and therefore contaminants from other species cannot be
    detected [Alston-Roberts, Nature reviews 2010].</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Third, cancer cell lines are genetically unstable, and LOH or
    microsatellite instability result in a reduction in matching
    precision. Whether one chooses to amplify the DNA with a whole
    genome amplification approach or to use no PCR at all, either
    approach can be part of a robust re-identification method since
    there is no need to rely on a limited number of specific bi-allelic
    sites. The reliance on a small set of markers makes a
    reidentification method sensitive to allelic dropouts.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>...</p>
<p>Second, for the forensics field:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Multiple studies have shown that the statistical power of 48-52
    SNPs is comparable to the current 10-15 STRs used (for example:
    Sanchez et al., 2010 and Yu et al., 2015. Moreover, Lin et al., 2004
    showed in a theoretical framework that ~80 random SNPs are
    sufficient to discriminate individuals from each other. Our study
    shows that we indeed re-identify DNA using only 60-300 SNP markers.
    The reason for our range is A) we randomly sample from the genome
    and encounter variants that are more informative then others due to
    their allele frequency. This is immediately the advantage, as we
    don’t rely on specific sites in the genome, and we therefore do not
    suffer from allelic dropouts. B) We have to work with a relative
    high error-rate. Even so, we show in our manuscript that we robustly
    identify individuals without exceptions.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>We acknowledge some major hurdles still need to be taken before
    this method can be implemented in the field. However, doesn’t the
    reviewer agree there is space to improve our forensics methodologies
    in speed and efficiency? This manuscript suggests a solid way to do
    it, using cutting edge technology, and proposes yet another step
    forward to make this happen.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our work can certainly be reproduced:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>The genomes of YE001, JP001 and the HapMap samples (NA12890) are
    available online (https://dna.land/consent). To increase the
    database size, OpenSNP.org reference files can be downloaded. The
    DNA samples of NA12890 can be purchased – and DNA from YE001, SZ001
    and JP001 can be requested, if desired, upon reasonable request.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>For cell line authentication we provide the CCLE database (1,099
    reference files) in the correct format, ready to use. Our method can
    be tested, and our data can be reproduced using that database and
    DNA from any cell line in the CCLE database.</p>
